                    <p><b>About the Department:</b></p>
                    <p>The B.Tech Aeronautical Engineering started operating over a decade since the year 2004 with total seats 60 offered and since 2010 PG course M.Tech Aerospace with total 60 seats. Students in these graduate engineering programs learn the science of flight, both for aircraft and spacecraft.</p>
                    <p>The department's curriculum includes five professional and three open elective courses in addition to courses on basic humanities and sciences, basic engineering, and core aeronautical engineering.</p>
                    <p>It is a 4-year full-time B.Tech Degree program covering important areas of Aeronautical Engineering such as Aerodynamics, Aircraft structures, Flight Dynamics, Propulsion, Avionics, Aircraft Systems, and Aircraft Maintenance.</p>
                    <p>Students receive continuous training in Modeling and Simulation software packages used extensively in Aerospace Industries, such as CATIA, ANSYS, etc.</p>
                    <p>Practical exposure is provided in laboratory facilities including Mechanics of Solids Lab, Aircraft Structures Lab, Aerodynamics and Propulsion Lab, Fluid and Flight Vehicle Design Lab, etc.</p>
                    <p>The Department aims to produce graduates who will be leaders in their field and contribute to industrial development and economic growth by preparing skilled manpower and supporting R&D work for industries.</p>
                    <p>Efforts have been made to seek cooperation from various government institutions/agencies such as Indian Air Force, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, National Aerospace Laboratory, DRDO, etc., to facilitate internships and industrial visits.</p>
                    <p>The department has been accredited by NBA, AICTE, New Delhi.</p>
